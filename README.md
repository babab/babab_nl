# Personal website of Benjamin Althues

It has a webpy backend, bootstrap frontend and is fully open-source. You may
use (components of) the code as long as you respect the license.

Before I decided to use webpy for my website, it was written in Django.
Checkout the 'django' tag in the git history if you're interested.
